This is a Random Sandwich Generator made with Django for JTC.

# To use this Django App create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```
# Then, you need to activate your virtual environment.
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
# or
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
# or
venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```
# Then, you need to install the requirements.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Finally, you can run the app. First cd to the app directory.
```sh
cd sandwich_box
# Now start the Django server!
python manage.py runserver
```
